            <h1>Distrust to the Tokugawa</h1>

            <p>Before 1854, Japan had a strict policy of isolationism, Japan refused to 
                trade with most foreign countries. However, In 1854, the U.S. 
                Navy captain led an expedition that forced Japan to trade with other
                 countries. This started rapid Westernization. The unfair treaties that 
                 followed angered many Japanese people. As a result, the Tokugawa government 
                 faced growing opposition, which turned into a radical movement pushing for change.
                </p>

                <p>Emperor Kōmei opposed foreign influence and broke tradition by 
                    getting involved in politics. He strongly protested the treaties
                     and tried to influence the next shogun. In 1863, he ordered foreigners
                      to be expelled, sparking attacks on them and the shogunate. In fact, 
                       English trader Charles Lennox Richardson was assassinated. The british 
                       demanded 100,000 British pounds, however they refused to pay.</p>

                <p>In 1863 ~ 1864, foreign powers struck back, with Britain bombing 
                    Kagoshima and a multinational force attacking Shimonoseki. Meanwhile,
                     Chōshū fighters and rōnin tried to seize Kyoto but were defeated by 
                     shogunate forces. The shogunate then launched a campaign against Chōshū, 
                     forcing their surrender without fighting. However, Tokugawa rule weakened
                      as daimyōs started ignoring their authority.</p>

            <h1>The 2 sides divide</h1>
            <p>Distrust toward the Tokugawa led many to believe that a change in leadership
                 was necessary for Japan to modernize and secure its place in the world. 
                Many saw the Shogunate as an outdated and ineffective
                    system standing in the way of progress. This led to the Boshin War</p>


            <p>This conflict had two sides: the Imperial forces, backed by Satsuma,
                 Chōshū, and Tosa, who wanted to restore the emperor's power, modernize
                  Japan, and centralize control. The Tokugawa loyalists, including 
                  the Northern Coalition, opposed this, aiming to defend the Shogunate,
                   resist imperial rule, and maintain the feudal system.

            <h1>The Boshin War</h1>

            <p>The Boshin War was not one-sided from the beginning.
                 Tokugawa forces initially had the advantage, particularly 
                 due to their larger numbers. Early Imperial defeats allowed 
                 Tokugawa loyalists to hold off the advancing Imperial army. However,
                  the Imperial forces eventually overcame Tokugawa's outdated military technology.
                
                </p>

                <p>The Meiji period officially began after
                     the Imperial forces defeated the Tokugawa 
                     Shogunate's loyalists and captured Edo (Tokyo)
                      in 1868. Although the war continued until 1869 with
                       final resistance in Hokkaidō, the Meiji Restoration
                        was symbolized by the fall of Edo and the restoration 
                        of imperial rule under Emperor Meiji. The transition
                         to the Meiji period marked the end of Tokugawa rule
                          and the beginning of significant modernization efforts
                           across Japan.</p>

                <h1 id="conclusion">Summary</h1>
                <p>In conclusion, distrust in the tokugawa led to a war to overthrow them. This war is called the Boshin War which resulted in the Tokugawa's defeat and a start to the Meiji Period</p>
