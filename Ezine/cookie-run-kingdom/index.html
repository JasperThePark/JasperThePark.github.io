  <p>Oh my goodness - silent salt cookie sneak peeks from <b>Silent Salt: Kingdom</b> have just dropped recently and I cannot put into words how much I am excited for this update. For starters, this update will drop on <b>the 24th of November</b> along with 2 new cookies: <b>Silent Salt</b> and his underling.</p>

<p>To be honest, the <b>Silent Salt cookie</b> has got to be one of my favourite cookies by far. Especially gameplay-wise too, in which I'll tell you why: his ability summons his horse called <b>Nox Black Salt</b> and he dashes forward with his steed, slashing the moon in two exploding parts. It deals <b>AOE damage</b> to cookies and his base cooldown is <b>14 seconds</b>!</p>

<p>People are saying that he could be <b>the best beast yet to come</b>. Some are also saying that he will knock <b>Shadow Milk Cookies</b> out of the current arena meta, but I doubt that.</p>

<p>Along with his awesome abilities, his design is also phenomenal and outstanding compared to the others. First, his main colour palette is a <b>greyish purple</b> colour which really fits his aesthetic. He often wears his knightly armour with a jagged sword, making him so mysterious. I love it! He has also never shown his face.</p>

<p>Anyways, that's generally my opinion on the new coming <b>Silent Salt cookie</b> and I hope I get him while drawing in the gacha. <u>Until soon!</u></p>
