    <!-- STORY CONTENT -->
    <div class="story-content">

  <p>The world's most famous sneaker brand, <b>Nike</b>. It has the most shares in the world right now. I even wear them often. I think the reason for its popularity is that they made the sophisticated, unique designs of the shoes and were very high-tech and comfortable for its time.</p>

<p>This is <b>Nike's history</b> to show how it became such a big company. Nike’s history begins in <b>1960</b>. Nike still hadn't made their own brand yet. The Founder of Nike, <b>Phil Knight</b>, had just graduated from the University of Oregon. Later, he enrolled at <b>Stanford business school</b>. He decided to start a business after graduation selling sports shoes.</p>

<p>The reason why he decided to sell the shoes is because after he graduated from University of Oregon, he went to Japan for the graduation trip. And he had a <u>fateful encounter</u> with a shoe company called <b>Onitsuka Tiger</b>, also known as Asics. He was really impressed by the quality and cheap cost of the shoes that the Onitsuka Tiger made. Later, he graduated from the Business School and he went back to Japan again to make a contract that he wanted to make an Onitsuka Tiger’s distributor shop in the US. The Onitsuka CEO accepted this offer but the shop’s name was not Nike yet. It was called <b>BRS, Blue Ribbon Sports</b>.</p>

<p>Moved onto the 1970s, their relationship between Nike and Onitsuka weakened. There were many reasons for this, the biggest two reasons were that there was a problem with importing products from Japan and BRS made their original shoes called <b>Cortez</b>. These shoes' designs were inspired by the shoes from the Onitsuka Tiger called <b>Tiger Cortez</b>. The Cortez from BRS was too similar to Tiger Cortez, with the names and designs of the shoe. Onitsuka Tiger sued BRS due to this. But sadly, they lost and Onitsuka had to change the tiger cortez’s name into <b>Tiger Corsair</b>. In my opinion, I think this made Nike to be independent and Nike Cortez became a representation of shoes that Nike produced. If this case didn't happen, maybe Nike would've stayed as a small brand called BRS forever.</p>

<p>With the experience that Nike made while they were with Onitsuka, Nike were now independent and made their own brand, the official <b>Nike</b>. They made many shoes that are using modern designs and technology.</p>
