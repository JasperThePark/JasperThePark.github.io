    <div class="subtitle">The best rapper can be debated agian and again but what's the truth?</div>

    <!-- STORY CONTENT -->
    <div class="story-content">

  <p>Who is your favorite rapper? Since the 1970s, rapping has been on the rise, and over the years, not only has listening to rap become more common, making rap has also been popularized. There are tens of thousands of rappers, but <b><u>who is the best</u></b>? Today I'm here to give you my take on this subject as well as my reasons.</p>

  <p>In my opinion, Chief Keef is the fifth-best rapper in the world. He is an older rapper from the late 2000s. Growing up in O Block (Parkway Gardens), he listened to a variety of music throughout his childhood. He once stated that his music is influenced by <b>everything he listens to</b> and eventually brought his neighborhood to national attention. His most notable pieces are Faneto, Love Sosa, and I Don't Like.</p>

  <p>Next up, NLE Choppa deserves 4th place in the ranking of rappers. He is best known for his breakout songs Shotta Flow and Capo. He probably would have been higher up the list, but ever since he started making a new style of music, my liking for him has plummeted. However, I still love his old music and a few of the new ones.</p>

  <p>Controversial to common belief, I think Youngboy Never Broke Again gets third place. He has been charged with attempted murder, kidnapping, assault, drug possession and distribution, firearms violations, and prescription fraud. Yeah, not the best, I don't support him, but that doesn't change the <b>quality</b> of his music. My favourite songs of his are Green Dot, I Hate Youngboy, and Make No Sense.</p>

  <p>In second place, I have Polo G; unlike most rap songs, his songs are chill and calm. His style of music may not be favored by most, but in my opinion, every once in a while, having that difference changes my day. His most popular song is RAPSTAR, which I highly recommend.</p>

  <p>Finally, in first place, I put King Von. He had <b>exceptional</b> talent and was unique to all. He was a <b>legend</b> of his time. However, at the young age of 26, he was shot and visited the afterlife before us. His most popular songs are his Crazy Story Parts, like Crazy Story Pt1 or Pt2. He may have been known to be an awful person, but every song of his tells a story, and so do his days.</p>

  <p>Rappers have existed for quite long but the 5 rappers above would have to be the very best. Of course, there are tens of thousands of rappers so you may disagree with me, but this is just <b>my</b> take on this.
