    <!-- STORY CONTENT -->
    <div class="story-content">
      <p>What if we could travel to the past? Humans have dreamed of time travel for hundreds of years. A concept of traveling back and forth in time itself! While there are debates speculating which is significantly better, you and I both know the past is what we wish to <b><u>change</u></b>.</p>

      <p>Two years ago, I started homeschooling – and at first, life felt completely free. I could do whatever I wanted, skip the impatient subjects and do what I loved. I disciplined myself and for the first year—I kept up with schoolwork. In fact, I had time for things I enjoyed! Fishing, horseback riding, golf, snowboarding, video editing, designing, modeling. My life was—plentiful.</p>

      <p>However, all good things must come to an end. I started focusing less on the core subjects and more on side subjects. These eventually became distractions rather than studies. I could have done better. By the time I realized core subjects are the fundamentals for side subjects—I was doomed.</p>

      <p>Afterwards, I became fascinated in time travel. No, not for the future; for the past. But I’m not here to complain. I’m sure you have a story similar to mine, <i>what if I did this? Or if I only changed this?</i> We all have countless regrets in the past. I would have visited my grandfather more if I knew his life was nearing its end. But we can't <b>change the past</b>. The word "past" itself is referring to what has passed away. It is <u>"what has gone by in time and no longer exists"</u>.</p>

      <p>But what if it could exist? Just a century ago, people didn’t think space travel was possible, people didn’t have personal laptops or phones. The internet wasn’t even a thing! The impossible are proven wrong again and again as our technology increases. And if I’m going to be honest? I think we can go to the past, but not the way you’d expect.</p>

      <p>Time traveling to the past doesn't mean changing the inevitable. It just means reliving our past, we might feel the pain of losing someone again. But we can't change what has happened, when watching a movie we can’t delete the movie because of a bad ending. Doing so is making a new movie, a new reality.</p>

      <p>We are constantly hiking a steep mountain towards the future. We might have lost resources or friends along the way, but going back is a spiral to sadness, hurt and pain. Our goal is beyond. And the journey along the way, not to retrace our steps. We can dream up even more paths, but we have to face reality. Humans can’t change the past, we can only <b><u>choose</u></b> what we do <b>now</b>.</p>
