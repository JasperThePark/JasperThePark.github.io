    <p>But in case you are curious, this website was made by Jasper Hung. I used a lot of tools to help me, including chatgpt, gemini, Visual Studio Code, Github, Html, Css, Javascript, and my brain.(Ai helped me code but i still did most of the designing and structuring or debuggin myself) </p>
    <p>I also have to give credit to my peers, I thank them for the stories submitted and the Ezine team, who helped me polish the stories.</p>
